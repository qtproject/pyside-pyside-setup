# PySide6 Addons

PySide6 is the official Python module from the
[Qt for Python project](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python),
which provides access to the complete Qt 6.0+ framework.

The Qt for Python project is developed in the open, with all facilities you'd expect
from any modern OSS project such as all code in a git repository and an open
design process. We welcome any contribution conforming to the
[Qt Contribution Agreement](https://www.qt.io/contributionagreement/).

This is a complementary wheel for [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6),
it includes the following Qt modules:

* Qt3DAnimation
* Qt3DCore
* Qt3DExtras
* Qt3DInput
* Qt3DLogic
* Qt3DRender
* QtAxContainer
* QtBluetooth
* QtCharts
* QtDataVisualization
* QtMultimedia

### Licensing

PySide6 is available under both Open Source (LGPLv3/GPLv2) and commercial

content of the wheels is valid for both cases.  For more information, refer to
the [Qt Licensing page](https://www.qt.io/licensing/).
