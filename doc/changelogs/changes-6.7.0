****************************************************************************

 - setup.py now uses CMake Unity Build Mode by default.
 - The namespace QAudio has been renamed to QtAudio in Qt 6.7. An alias
   has been created, but it may not work in all cases.
 - pyside6-project now has an lupdate mode updating translation files (.ts)
   from the sources.
 - Python code has been updated to be free of flake8 warnings using
   a custom configuration.
 - For deployment, the supported version of Nuitka has been raised to 2.1.0.
 - singleShot timers with a timeout of 0 now call the C++ function (which
   directly calls QMetaObject::invokeMethod) instead of manually creating and
   starting a timer object, slightly improving performance.
 - [PYSIDE-769]  QtAsyncio: Fix a missing attribute error on Windows. Fix
 - [PYSIDE-2641] QtAsyncio.run() not returning the result of a coroutine. It
                 is now possible to disable the signal handler for SIGINT by
                 passing a parameter to run(). The loop policy is reset after
                 run() finishes.
 - [PYSIDE-838]  Functions qCompress/qUncompress() taking a PyBuffer/len
                 arguments have been fixed.
 - [PYSIDE-1106] Documentation: Decorators, global functions and enumerations
                 are now documented add indexed from the module page. The class
                 documentation now uses more sphinx domain directives.
                 Pages for all tools have been added. The order of the examples
                 list has been changed to show relevant examples first.
 - [PYSIDE-1275] QObject.disconnect() now returns False with a warning instead
                 of raising an exception for non-fatal cases.
 - [PYSIDE-1612] Deployment: Issues when using pyenv have been fixed. The
                 finding of dependent modules has been improved. On Windows,
                 this now requires the dumpbin tool, which is added to the path
                 by calling the vcvarsall.bat script of Microsoft Visual
                 Studio.
 - [PYSIDE-1612] Android Deployment: The NDK version in the tool has been
                 updated. Python has been updated to 3.11. CMake version 3.23
                 is now required. The wheels are no longer built with
                 --limited-api. The generated pysidedeploy.spec has an explicit
                 group called `android` which stores the wheels and plugins.
 - [PYSIDE-1906] Hash value calculation has been optimized.
 - [PYSIDE-2206] The colorpaletteclient demo as well as the hellographs and
                 simplerhiwidget examples have been added.
 - [PYSIDE-2215] Intersphinx support has been improved.
 - [PYSIDE-2280] A type for os.PathLike type hints has been added.
 - [PYSIDE-2404] Application startup time has been significantly decreased
                 by creating the types on demand. The importing of numpy
                 has also been deferred since it caused quite some delay.
 - [PYSIDE-2432] A static create() function for decorated QML singletons
                 has been added.
 - [PYSIDE-2484] The QML type registration code has been ported to use
                 RegisterTypeAndRevisions.
 - [PYSIDE-2535] Obtaining DBUS properties from QDBusInterface has been fixed.
                 As a consequence though, it is no longer possible to derive a
                 Python class with signals/slots from QDBusInterface.
 - [PYSIDE-2504] Documentation: Option 'build_rst_docs' has been deprecated in
                 favor of 'build_base_docs'.
 - [PYSIDE-2524] It is now possible to connect signals to slots/lambdas with
                 more arguments provided they have default parameters.
 - [PYSIDE-2524] The signal connection code has been optimized.
 - [PYSIDE-2543] QtQuickTest has been added.
 - [PYSIDE-2576] Documentation: The extendedexplorer tutorial has been improved.
 - [PYSIDE-2590] Some fixes have been made be able to cope with namespaced Qt
                 builds.
 - [PYSIDE-2610] The QTextureImageData methods returning an enumeration of
                 QOpenGLTexture have been added.
 - [PYSIDE-2605] An error about the C++ object being deleted when calling
                 QWidget.style() in an embedded application has been fixed.
 - [PYSIDE-2468] Deployment: Support for the Qt permission API has been added.
                 macOS bundle applications are now created.
 - [PYSIDE-2597] Desktop Deployment: The the plugins included have been
                 optimized.
 - [PYSIDE-2633] C++ typedefs of container instantiations are now
                 registered in Python under their name, making possible
                 to decorate slots with those names (for example,
                 "QRemoteObjectSourceLocation").
 - [PYSIDE-2639] Segmentation fault with QLocale.system() has been fixed.
 - [PYSIDE-2652] A bug when passing values of unsigned long long type
                 exceeding the long long maximum value to float
                 parameters has been fixed.
 - [PYSIDE-2663] A crash in QtWebEngine browsing https://outlook.com has been
                 fixed.
 - [PYSIDE-2668] A bug when comparing QOperatingSystemVersion::OSType
                 has been fixed.
 - [QTBUG-119785] The Filesystemexplorer-example has been updated.

*                                  Shiboken6                               *
****************************************************************************

 - [PYSIDE-31]   Shiboken.wrapInstance() now returns existing instances
                 (preserving ids).
 - [PYSIDE-560]  libshiboken/Limited API: No longer needed PyTypeObject slots
                 have been disabled in the PyTypeObject helper struct.
 - [PYSIDE-1106] A typesystem attribute providing a hint to a documentation
                 file has been added to function/enum type entries
                 (for globals).
 - [PYSIDE-1106] Documentation can now be injected from separate .rst files.
 - [PYSIDE-1106] Documentation injected into classes with "append" will now
                 be appended to the class description instead of being written
                 at the end of the page.
 - [PYSIDE-1106] Documentation: It is now possible to inject documentation
                 for parameters of added functions.
 - [PYSIDE-2230] Python 3.12: Hidden Type Extensions according to PEP 697
                 are now used instead of shadow dictionaries.
 - [PYSIDE-2404] The generated type index constants are no longer in
                 uppercase. Uppercase is retained until deprecation in
                 PySide7.
 - [PYSIDE-2447] A typesystem attribute to generate submodules has been added.
 - [PYSIDE-2535] Generating the Qt meta object functions handling the PySide6
                 signals can now be disabled by a typesystem attribute. This
                 is useful for classes using dynamic meta objects, for
                 example QDBusInterface.
