"""Show the series through one build's eyes, with the conditionals resolved.

The free-threading work is supposed to leave a build with a GIL alone. That is
a claim a reviewer cannot check by reading a diff full of #ifdef - so resolve
them and let the text speak. unifdef(1) rewrites only the Py_GIL_DISABLED
conditionals and leaves every other line untouched, which is what makes the
result still readable; cpp -E would expand headers and macros and destroy it.

    gil_view.py                 GIL view of BASE vs HEAD - what the shipped
                                build actually gets out of the series
    gil_view.py --ft            FT view of HEAD - the free-threaded side with
                                no conditionals left, for reviewing the design
    gil_view.py --generated     the same over the generated wrappers in the
                                build tree, which is where the bulk sits
    gil_view.py --check         the GIL view as a test: fails when the series
                                changes code a build with a GIL compiles;
                                the generator's sources are left to --wrappers
    gil_view.py --selftest      the check against cases with a known answer
    gil_view.py --check --wrappers BASE_TREE HEAD_TREE
                                the same over the wrappers two GIL builds
                                generated - the generator's own source says
                                nothing, it only prints the conditionals

--check compares code, not text: comments and blank lines are taken out
first. There are no exceptions: a change a build with a GIL would see goes
behind Py_GIL_DISABLED, with the base's text in the #else branch.

Writes plain diff/text files and prints their paths. Nothing to install.
