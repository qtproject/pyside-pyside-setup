The Qt Charts module provides a set of easy-to-use chart components. It uses
the Qt Graphics View Framework to integrate charts with modern user interfaces.
Qt Charts can be used as QWidgets,
:class:`QGraphicsWidget<PySide6.QtWidgets.QGraphicsWidget>` , or QML types.
Users can easily create impressive charts by selecting one of the themes.

To include the definitions of modules classes, use the following
